# Referral-Based Learning Rewards – Invite Friends and Earn

## 📌 Project Description

This project implements a **referral-based rewards system** on the Stacks blockchain using the Clarity smart contract language. Users can invite friends to join a learning platform, and they receive rewards when their friends register using their referral.

---

## 🌟 Project Vision

The goal is to create a **decentralized and transparent incentive system** that encourages users to grow a learning community by referring others. Each successful referral is tracked on-chain and can be tied to rewards like tokens, points, or badges.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- ✅ Add automatic reward transfers (e.g., tokens or NFTs).
- 📈 Implement referral tiers (e.g., bronze/silver/gold referrers).
- 🔒 Add cooldowns or limits to prevent abuse.
- 📊 Build a leaderboard of top referrers.
- 🧠 Integrate with off-chain educational platforms for learning validation.
